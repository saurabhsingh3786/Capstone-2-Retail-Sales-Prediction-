The KDE plot provides a smooth estimate of the probability density function, giving a clearer view of the underlying data distribution.\n",

        "3. Skewness and Outliers: The histogram can reveal if the 'Sales' distribution is skewed (asymmetric) or contains outliers. Skewness and outliers can be important insights to understand the sales behavior in the dataset.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. Central Tendency: The peak of the histogram (highest frequency bin) indicates the central tendency of the data, which is around 6,000 to 8,000 sales. This is where the most frequent sales values are concentrated.\n",

        "3. Spread and Variability: The spread of the data can be observed by looking at the width of the distribution. The wider the spread, the more variability there is in the sales values. In this case, the spread appears to be moderate, as the distribution covers a range of sales values from around 0 to 40,000.\n",

Sundays, on the other hand, have significantly lower footfall, which may be due to many businesses being closed or operating with reduced hours on Sundays.
